Multilayers documentation
=========================

The **Multilayer** package is a package to calculate the reflection, transmission and absorption (profiles) of light incident on a flat multilayer stack of different materials. It contains a library of given and measured refractive indices for various materials. The input is the *light* properties (wavelength, FWHM, polarization), *geometry* (angle of incidence, layer thicknesses) and *materials* (layers and front and back media).

# TMM - Transfer Matrix-method calculations

The **TMM** package is a package to alculate the reflection, transmission and absorbtion (profile) of light through a flat multilayer stack.

# Installing

Clone/download the repository. Then install with

>pip install .

preferably in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

# Documentation
